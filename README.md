# Hand Gesture Classification with Trained Model

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture classification using a pre-trained model.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Necessary libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

**Model Download:**

- Download the `model.p` file (trained model) from this link: [https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mahi_talukder_student_lut_fi/EagauFcTJ9RKq\_\_ozxKwZbEBs5PcS7pplqnXgB_rW2rFGA?e=T1avhq](https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mahi_talukder_student_lut_fi/EagauFcTJ9RKq__ozxKwZbEBs5PcS7pplqnXgB_rW2rFGA?e=T1avhq)
- Place the downloaded `model.p` file in the project's root directory.

**Running the Inference:**

1. **Install dependencies:** Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.
2. **Run the script:** Navigate to the project directory and run `python inference.py` to start the real-time classification.
